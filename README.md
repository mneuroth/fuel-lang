# fuel-lang == FUEL(isp)
FUEL(isp) is a fast usable embeddable lisp interpreter (currently for the .NET platform and native C++). 
FUEL is written in C# and C++.

FUEL
----
FUEL is a lisp interperter which is intended to be used as a scripting
and extension language for applications.

FUEL comes with a command line application which can execute programs: 

    >type test.fuel
    (println "hello fuel")
    
    >fuel.exe test.fuel
    hello fuel
  
The FUEL interpreter can easily be embedded into .NET applications.
Just link the CsLispInterpreter.dll to your .NET solution and use
the static Lisp.Eval() function.

    using CsLisp;
  
    ...
  
    // script = "(* 6 7)"
    private double InvokeFuelScript(string script)
    {
        // evaluate the given script
        LispVariant result = Lisp.Eval(script);
        
        // convert result to expected type
        double d = result.DoubleValue;
        
        // returns 42
        return d;
    }
  
Objects from the embedding application can easily be registered 
at the FUEL interpreter and used in a script.

    private double InvokeFuelScriptWithAppObj(string script, string appObjName, object appObj)
    {
        var nativeItems = new Dictionary<string, object>();
        nativeItems[appObjName] = appObj;
        
        // script = '(call appObjName "MethodName" args ...)'
        LispVariant result = Lisp.Eval(script, nativeItems: nativeItems);
        
        return result.DoubleValue;
    }

Even complete classes can be registered at the FUEL interpreter.

    (import fuellib)
    
    ;; register in FUEL script
    (evalstr (create-native "FUEL_name" "full_NET_name"))
    
    ;; use in FUEL script
    (def obj (create-FUEL_name))    ; create native object
    (FUEL_name-DoIt obj 123)        ; use native object
    

The FUEL interpreter can also easily be embedded into native C++ applications.
Just add the source code files contained in the CppLispInterpreter.pri file to your C++ project
and use the static Lisp::Eval() function.

    #include "Lisp.h"
    
    using namespace CppLisp;
    
    ...
  
    // script = "(* 6 7)"
    static double InvokeFuelScript(const string & script)
    {
        // evaluate the given script
        std::shared_ptr<LispVariant> result = Lisp::Eval(script);
        
        // convert result to expected type
        double d = result->DoubleValue();
        
        // returns 42
        return d;
    }

    
Interactive loop
----------------
FUEL comes with an interactive loop.

    >fuel -i
  
    FUEL(isp) v0.99.1 (for .NET/C#) from 31.3.2016, (C) by Michael Neuroth
  
    Type "help" for informations.
  
    FUEL(isp)-DBG> (println "Hello fuel")
    hello fuel
    result=Hello fuel
    FUEL(isp)-DBG>

  
Debugger
--------
FUEL comes with a command line debugger. 

    >fuel -d test.fuel
  
    FUEL(isp) v0.99.1 (for .NET/C#) from 31.3.2016, (C) by Michael Neuroth
  
    Type "help" for informations.
  
    --> do line=1 start=-3 stop=-1 module=test.fuel
    FUEL(isp)-DBG>
  
A graphical front end for the debugger is available in the VisiScript
Text Editor in version 0.6.0 and above.

Compiler
--------
FUEL comes with a compiler (experimental). The compiler is not yet implemented for the native C++ environment.

    >fuel -c test.fuel
  

Documentation
-------------
For more documentation of the FUEL language see:

    >fuel --doc
  
Or navigate to the homepage(s):

https://github.com/mneuroth/fuel-lang
    
http://mneuroth.de/projects/Fuel.html.
  
Or inspect the demo and test scripts and
look at the TestAppUsingFuel project.


Compiling
---------
To compile the C# version of fuel just open the solution file CsLisp/CsLisp.sln in
Microsoft Visual Studio and build the solution.

To compile the C++ version of fuel open the solution file CppLisp/CppLisp.sln in
Microsoft Visual Studio and build the solution. Or use the qmake tool from [Qt](https://www.qt.io/):

    >cd CppLisp
    >qmake -r CppLisp.pro
    >make
    
The CMake build tool is also supported:

    >cd CppLisp
    >cmake CMakeLists.txt
    >make
